Here is the anatomy of this code:

starting with popup.js:
    -first makes sure we are youtube
    -then adds a click functionality to the two buttons: download caption & start quiz (quiz.html)
    -holds a listener to update the subtitles live. this listens from content.js

    so for the download captions functionality, this sends a command to content.js

now onto content.js:
    -first holds a mutation observer to observe the changes in captions live
    -it listens to the command from popup.js = download captions
    -if it receives this command, it activates the downloadcaptions fucntion.
    -this fuction sends a command to background.js

finally, background.js:
    -it holds the code for initiate download. so basically it listens from content.js and
    starts the download
